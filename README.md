# Secure Laptop Configuration Documentation

These are preliminary musings that reflect my research towards my plan to create
a reproducible, turn-key configuration for a personal/business laptop that can
be safely carried anywhere, with good protection against data theft, forced disclosure,
having good deniability, and protected network access.

Work in progress, obviously.

## Parts:

1. [Boot plan](./boot-plan.md)
1. [Network topology](./network-topology.md)
1. [BitVPN](./bitvpn.md)
1. [Idempotence and impermanence](./idempotence-and-impermanence.md)
