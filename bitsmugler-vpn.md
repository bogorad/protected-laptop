BitVPN vs BitSmuggler – Same disguise, different universes

- 0-second summary

  - BitSmuggler = “Let’s ferry **Tor traffic** through an unmodified BitTorrent _swarm_ the same way Tor ferries TCP.”
  - BitVPN = “Let’s build **a fresh VPN** whose **entire appearance** is a single BitTorrent file transfer.”

Everything else is consequence.

---

1.  Threat-model fit and primary goal

- BitSmuggler:

  - Designed as a **Tor pluggable transport** (like obfs4, ScrambleSuit).
  - Goal is merely to let an already-running Tor client reach its first Tor bridge **invisibly**.
  - Once traffic hits the bridge it re-enters normal Tor circuits; anonymity & path selection remain Tor’s job.

- BitVPN:
  - Designed as a **stand-alone VPN** for a closed group, not a Tor helper.
  - Goal is to give the user a SOCKS5 proxy that spits traffic directly onto the open Internet (via your own exit nodes).
  - Traffic is at most single-hop; anonymity is non-goal, unblockability **and** confidentiality are.

2. Rendezvous / discovery

- BitSmuggler
  - **Server list lives in Tor bridge descriptors** obtained out-of-band (HTTPS-email, moat, etc.).
  - You connect to a **single bridge** that the descriptor names. No global search needed.

* BitVPN
  - Day-to-day server discovery is **fully automatic via DHT**:  
    info_hash = SHA1(secret + UTC-date).
  - Clients pick the **lowest-latency node** and fail-over to siblings, giving high-availability and multi-exit load-balancing.

3. Peer appearance and per-packet camouflage

- BitSmuggler
  - Uses a **real** uTorrent/Deluge binary that thinks it is downloading/seeding some torrent (e.g. Ubuntu ISO).
  - A helper process **sits between** TCP and that client, swapping Piece payloads.
  - Therefore traffic is **perfectly genuine**—every HAVE, Bitfield, choking algorithm is the real client’s logic.

* BitVPN
  - No real BitTorrent client is involved.
  - BitVPN processes **speak BitTorrent wire-protocol themselves**, but they fake only **what is necessary**: handshake, PEX, Piece exchange, etc.
  - Advantage: they can open/close torrents at will, insert dummy Piece flows, tune buffer sizes.
  - Risk: fidelity to **thousands of small corner cases** across clients/versions must be audited by hand.

4. Cover-traffic long-livedness

- BitSmuggler

  - Once the pair finishes exchanging that ISO, you must **switch swarms** or the throughput drops to zero.
  - Project paper proposes cookie-preserved reconnection to a _new_ torrent hash supplied by the server.  
    => Big operational overhead on the bridge operator.

- BitVPN
  - The “bait file” never actually finishes. BitVPN endpoints repeatedly send **random Piece ranges** plus random `HAVE`s until the user session ends.  
    => One torrent is good for days; no swarm-change dance is required.

5. Trust & deployment surface

- BitSmuggler

  - **Single operator per bridge**; bridge descriptor already contains the bridge’s long-term identity.
  - Requires exact filenames/hashes in descriptor ⇒ any tweak needs new descriptors pushed via Tor bridges channel.

- BitVPN
  - Administrator spins up as many machines as desired; each has its own keypair, all listed in user’s trusted list.
  - User software automatically load-balances; adding/removing nodes is transparent because discovery is _data-driven_ (daily hash), not glue-driven (descriptor file).

6. Crypto tailoring

- BitSmuggler

  - Curve25519 + Elligator handshake embedded inside Piece #0 (first message).
  - Elligator makes the 32-byte **public key** look like pure noise; AES-GCM afterward.
  - Elligator non-standard at the time ⇒ no audited code available.

- BitVPN
  - Uses existing, well-tested **TLS-1.3 (via XTLS)** atop its covert channel.  
    – A second symmetric key (`obfuscation_key`) only hides the TLS hello.
  - Relies on regular PKI cipher-suites, hardware AES & ChaCha20-Poly1305 already audited.
  - Eliminates elliptic-curve steganography novelty risk.

7. User visible primitive

- BitSmuggler

  - Pluggable-transport DLL/ext; replaces `obfs4proxy`.
  - Tor Browser launches it and _forgets_ it exists.

- BitVPN
  - Stand-alone EXE that **exposes SOCKS5 on localhost:1080**. You set Firefox, curl, etc. to use it regardless of Tor.

8. Fail-stop & side-channel profile

Both are susceptible to timing analysis, but mitigation commitment differs.

- BitSmuggler

  - Depends on _a real client_ whose I/O bursts follow user disk-seek delays + BT algorithm; may or may not mould to cover pattern.
  - Paper explicitly leaves _“packet inter-arrival time attack”_ open for future work.

- BitVPN
  - Designed to lean on _additional jitter scheduler_ on both ends so Piece arrivals may be deliberately ran-dom-ised against entropy fingerprint.
  - Open TODO: implement BPF-rate limiters that reshape bursts to mimic uTorrent’s noisy baseline.

9. Summary matrix

| **Feature**          | **BitSmuggler**           | **BitVPN**                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Tor transport layer       | Personal small-clique VPN   |
| **Multiplex**        | One bridge ↔ one client  | N servers, auto-failover    |
| **Discovery**        | Static bridge descriptor  | Daily DHT-derived hash      |
| **Camouflage depth** | Runs real uTorrent        | Re-implements protocol      |
| **Operational**      | Need swarm-switch         | Stay in one torrent forever |
| **Crypto brand**     | Elligator+AES-GCM         | TLS 1.3 (XTLS)              |
| **Deployment**       | Single exit per bridge    | Volunteer fleet of exits    |
| **Logging surface**  | Tor exit node (unchanged) | Admin of exit node = you    |

10. Quick verdict

If you already **run Tor bridges** and want an _experimental, single-hop cover_ for Chinese clients, BitSmuggler is surgically excellent.  
If you want a **zero-documentation, multi-node, everyday VPN that rides the greatest-common-denominator protocol**, BitVPN’s infrastructure-first design scales better.

Choose the knife that fits the cut.
